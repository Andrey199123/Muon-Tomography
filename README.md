# Muon Tomography with Geant4

1. **Geant4 Project**  
   - Source code for the simulation resides in `src/` with corresponding headers in `include/`.  
   - A `CMakeLists.txt` for building with CMake.

2. **Python Scripts**  
   - **`finishedProgram.py`**: Script showing how to load and visualize Geant4 output data (in `stepData.csv`) using PyVista or Matplotlib.  
   - **`originalImage.py`**: The old code previously used for visualization.  
   - **`stepData.csv`**: Example output generated by the Geant4 simulation.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Geant4** (properly installed, with environment variables set)  
2. **CMake** (>= 3.16 recommended)  
3. A **C++ compiler** (e.g., GCC or Clang)  
4. **Python 3**, with packages:  
   - `numpy`  
   - `pandas`  
   - `pyvista` (and VTK)  
   - *Optional:* `matplotlib` for alternate 3D plotting

## Building the Geant4 Simulation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MuonTomography.git
   cd MuonTomography
   ```

2. **Create a build directory (not tracked by Git)**:
   ```bash
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

3. **Run CMake and then build**:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   make -j4
   ```

   Adjust `-j4` to match the number of CPU cores on your machine.

4. **Executable**: You should now have an executable (e.g., `MuonBeamSimulation`) in the `build/` directory.

---

## Running the Geant4 Simulation

From the `build` directory:
```bash
./MuonBeamSimulation
```

---

## Analyzing and Visualizing the Data

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas pyvista matplotlib
   ```

   (You can do this in a virtual environment if you prefer.)

2. **Run the Python script**:
   ```bash
   python finishedProgram.py
   ```

   This script:
   - Reads `stepData.csv` (the Geant4 output).
   - Creates a 3D point cloud of the muon tracks (using PyVista).
   - Optionally filters high-/low-energy muons and can build a Delaunay/alpha-shape mesh to approximate container boundaries.

3. **Adjust thresholds**:
   - Change energy thresholds for filtering in the script.
